## Simple article template for Typst

This template does not use templates or packages from Typst Universe.

The explanations were given in the lines of comments in the file "article.typ". Editing in accordance with the comments may change name of Title, names of authors, etc.

I have tried to used "include" for chapters, bibliography and appendix. The cross-reference system did not work. I therefore embeded everything in 1 single file "article.typ".

I would be very grateful if some persons can teach me and amend for me.
